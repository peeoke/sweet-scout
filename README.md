# sweet-scout
An application designed to find your perfect sweet treat.

Project Title: SweetScout

Team Members: 
- Ysabella Dela Cruz (ysabella.delacruz@sjsu.edu)
- Kelly Dang (kelly.dang01@sjsu.edu)

Functionality:
  Through this application we aim to remedy the universal issue of deciding where to eat. As witnessed through personal experiences, we have both struggled to decide on the types of foods and drinks to get, and have wasted a lot of time trying to determine our treat. The application would randomly generate a specific food/drink, depending on what the user is looking for. The result of this is that the users would save a lot of time deciding on what food/drink to get and would now have a decision made for them. 

Application: 
  Our application will utilize both web scraping and web development. 

Approach:
  To collect the data for our application, will use a combination of the Google Maps API and the BeautifulSoup Python package. We will first querey the Google Maps API for the food locations within a user's vicinity. We will then scrape menu data from location websites to provide a more filtered search if a user choses to provide keywords. To deal with the server-side logic, we will either use the FastAPI package to provide multiple pages. For the frontend of our application we will utilize React to build an interactive user-interface.
