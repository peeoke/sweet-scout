# sweet-scout
An application designed to find your perfect sweet treat.

Project Title: SweetScout
Team Members: 
  Ysabella Dela Cruz (ysabella.delacruz@sjsu.edu)
  Kelly Dang (kelly.dang01@sjsu.edu)

Functionality:
  Through this application we aim to remedy the universal issue of deciding where to eat. As witnessed through personal experiences, we have both struggled to decide on the types of foods and drinks to get, and have wasted a lot of time trying to determine our treat. The application would randomly generate a specific food/drink, depending on what the user is looking for. The result of this is that the users would save a lot of time deciding on what food/drink to get and would now have a decision made for them. 

Application: 
  Our application will utilize both web scraping and web development. 

Approach:
